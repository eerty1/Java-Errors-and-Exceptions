# Java-errors and exceptions

I have nothing to say about this module. :frowning_face:

It's like an tasteless pie. :pie:

On the basis of the lectures, I managed to study basic things about errors and exceptions:

* How to throw them

* How to customize them

* When I should throw them

In the end I completed the main task. :heavy_check_mark:

## Requirements of the task

* The university has several faculties. 

* These faculties have groups. 

* There're students in these groups.

* Each student has several subjects in which he receives marks. 

* It is necessary to implement a hierarchy of students, groups and faculties.

======================================================================

* Find average mark of a student

* Find average mark according to certain data

* Find average mark for the whole university

======================================================================

Implement the following exceptions:

* Mark below 0 or above 10

* Student has no subjects (must have at least one)

* Absence of students in the group

* Absence of groups at the faculty

* The university has no faculties

## Installation

Since it is pure Java, you needn't any complicated actions. :trophy:

You are proposed to use Java 8.

There're the steps to unpack my project: 

* git clone Java-Errors-and-Exceptions

* Open it via your IDE

## Usage

There're no any peculiarities.

As I said before, just open it in your IDE and build the project.

I decided to let the program error free, that is why it is up to you, which variables to change during the simulation of exceptional cases
